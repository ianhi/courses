Beer foam quality is characterized by its stability, adherence to glass, and texture, which are inherently determined by the quality of the barley and hop raw materials used for beer production. In addition, beer production processes, addition of foam palliatives, packaging and method of dispense influence the basic foam quality determined by the raw materials. Elevated levels of key malt proteins and hop acids generally influence foam quality positively, while the inclusion of excessive levels of lipids, protein modification, and ethanol generally reduce foam quality. The primary objective of this review is to identify malt components that can be manipulated to produce beer foam of superior quality.},

	abstract = {Bubble nucleation sites in beer glasses should be uniformly small to ensure that the foam produced comprises homogenously small bubbles with attendant reduced degrees of disproportionation. The latter phenomenon is also hindered by increased film thickness in foam, which in turn will be enhanced by increased localised viscosity, encouraged perhaps by polysaccharide-polypeptide complexes. Erring on the “high end” of specification for carbon dioxide will promote replenishment of foam through beading. Nitrogen at a relatively low level (15–20 ppm) will hinder disproportionation with limited suppression of hop aroma and introduction of undesirable textural features. Hydrolysed hordein appears selectively to enter beer foams at the expense of the more foam-stabilising albuminous polypeptides, suggesting that any future procedures that might selectively eliminate hydrolysed hordein components from beer would be expected not only to enhance haze stability but also foam, by eliminating species that preferentially enter into the bubble but have less foam-stabilizing capability once they are there.},

Building on a parallel program and supporting tools which have enabled research utilising high performance computing resources for nearly two decades, {LB}3D version 7 provides a subset of the research code functionality as an open source project. Here, we describe the theoretical basis of the algorithm as well as computational aspects of the implementation. The software package is validated against simulations of meso-phases resulting from self-assembly in ternary fluid mixtures comprising immiscible and amphiphilic components such as water–oil–surfactant systems. The impact of the surfactant species on the dynamics of spinodal decomposition are tested and quantitative measurement of the permeability of a body centred cubic ({BCC}) model porous medium for a simple binary mixture is described. Single-core performance and scaling behaviour of the code are reported for simulations on current supercomputer architectures.

Simulation of fluid mixtures comprising miscible and immiscible fluid components as well as amphiphilic species on the mesoscopic scale. Observable phenomena include self-organisation of mesoscopic complex fluid phases and fluid transport in porous media. Solution method: Lattice-Boltzmann (lattice-Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook, {LBGK}) [1, 2, 3] method describing fluid dynamics in terms of the single particle velocity distribution function in a 3-dimensional discrete phase space (D3Q19) [4, 5, 6]. Multiphase interactions are modelled using a phenomenological pseudo-potential approach [7, 8] with amphiphilic interactions utilising an additional dipole field [9, 10]. Solid boundaries are modelled using simple bounce-back boundary conditions and additional pseudo-potential wetting interactions [11]. Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features: The purpose of the release is the provision of a refactored minimal version of {LB}3D suitable as a starting point for the integration of additional features building on the parallel computation and {IO} functionality.

	abstract = {Shan-Chen model is a numerical scheme to simulate multiphase fluid flows using Lattice Boltzmann approach. The original Shan-Chen model suffers from inability to accurately predict behavior of air bubbles interacting in a non-aqueous fluid. In the present study, we extended the Shan-Chen model to take the effect of the attraction-repulsion barriers among bubbles in to account. The proposed model corrects the interaction and coalescence criterion of the original Shan-Chen scheme in order to have a more accurate simulation of bubbles morphology in a metal foam. The model is based on forming a thin film (narrow channel) between merging bubbles during growth. Rupturing of the film occurs when an oscillation in velocity and pressure arises inside the channel followed by merging of the bubbles. Comparing numerical results obtained from proposed model with mettallorgraphy images for aluminum A356 demonstrated a good consistency in mean bubble size and bubbles distribution},

The above method allows for the direct incorporation of fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interactions as well as an applied external force. As a test of this method, we obtained Poiseuille flow for the case of a single fluid driven by a constant body force and obtained results consistent with Laplace’s law for the case of two immiscible fluids. The displacement of one fluid by another in a porous medium was then modeled. The relative permeability for different wetting fluid saturations of a microtomography-generated image of sandstone was calculated and compared favorably with experiment. In addition, we show that a first-order phase transition, in three dimensions, may be obtained by this lattice Boltzman method, demonstrating the potential for modeling phase transitions and multiphase flow in porous media. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

Simulations of crystal growth from a single or multiple nuclei in a domain initially filled with supersaturated solution are presented, such as in the case of gas hydrate formation. We find that as the process changes from diffusion-controlled to surface reaction-controlled, the crystal transforms from open cluster-type structure, via compact coral-type structure, to compact circular structure, and correspondingly, the fractal dimension of the crystal structure increases from a value close to that of a diffusion-limited aggregation ({DLA}) structure to the Euclidian value for a circle. At a high Damkohler number, crystal formed from a single nucleus becomes more compact as the saturation increases. At a low Damkohler number, the crystal has a fairly round shape for different saturation values and the effect of saturation is insignificant.},

Main points of discussion comprise the admissible model simplifications in order to obtain a more easily solvable model together with the question of which physical effects are of prime importance and which reliable correlations can be recommended or are still missing. It is shown that, for most practical cases, the two-fluid model can be simplified to a formulation which allows for the application of efficient solution strategies for single-phase flow. From the different interaction forces between gas and liquid, pressure and drag force are most important, whereas no sound experimental basis is available for (lateral) lift forces. So far, lift forces have primarily been used empirically to adjust the gas distribution to the experimental observation. The main open question concerns the prope! r modeling of turbulence in gas-liquid bubble flow since it affects both the mixture viscosity and the bubble dispersion. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 50: 24–45, 2004},

Bubbles grow and detach from nucleation sites: gas pockets trapped within hollow cellulose fibres. This mechanism appears not to be active in stout beers that are supersaturated solutions of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. In their canned forms these beers require additional technology (widgets) to release the bubbles which will form the head of the beer. We extend the mathematical model of bubble nucleation in carbonated liquids to the case of two gasses and show that this nucleation mechanism is active in stout beers, though substantially slower than in carbonated beers and confirm this by observation. A rough calculation suggests that despite the slowness of the process, applying a coating of hollow porous fibres to the inside of a can or bottle could be a potential replacement for widgets.},
